Column,Description
examples_condition,"Experimental condition, whether examples were shown or not."
teaching_condition,"Experimental condition, whether the examples shown were selected to be helpful according to the Bayesian Teacher."
rt,Response time in milliseconds.
stimulus,The target stimulus image.
response,The response category selected by the human participant.
correct,The response category selected by the AI (the response the human participant attempted to predict).
trial_number,The presentation order of the trials.
y_teaching_bin,The binned helpfulness of the examples shown (4 is most helpful 1 is least helpful).
prediction_type,"Whether the AI prediction was a true positive, a false positive or a false negative."
ground_truth,The ground truth class of the target image.
target_category,The AI classification of the target image.
other_category,Either the ground-truth class (when the AI made a mistake) or the most confusable class of the target image (when the AI was correct).
category_target_example_one,Image file for the first target example.
category_target_example_two,Image file for the second target example.
category_other_example_one,Image file for the first other example.
category_other_example_two,Image file for the second other example.
trial_order,The trial order in the experimental file (all trials with the same trial order contain the same target and the same classification options)
trial_index,
time_elapsed,Total time elapsed during the experimental session (including instructions and consent) in milliseconds.
subject_id,Unique participant identifier.
age,Participant self-reported age in years.
gender,Participant self-reported gender.
country,Participant self-reported country of residence.
label_condition,Label condition (whether the categories had informative labels or not)
highlights_condition,"The format of the saliency map used on a given trial (no saliency map, semi-transparent jet colored heatmap or blur)"
total_time,Total time to complete the experimen in seconds.
resnet_perf,The average classification accuracy for ResNet-50 for the target category.
familiar,Familiarity as a binary variable from a median split.
logp_learner_matches_target_model,The log-probability that the learner model makes the same classification as the target model conditional on having seen the examples.
familiar_yes_vote_fraction,Familiarity as a proportion of votes from human raters (different from the participants in this study).
log_rt,The logarithm of the response time in milliseconds.
